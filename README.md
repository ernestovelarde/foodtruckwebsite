# foodtruckwebsite
Website created for a start up food-truck business. 

The files contains HTML5, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript material. 

*OVERALL EXPERIENCE*

This was my very first page that was not made for school, it actually served a purposed for someone's business, something that i've never experience in my life. i learned alot while creating it and these are some of the tools that i used to deliver a final product. 


HTML5
-> Main use of the html file is to set a structure for the page created for this start up food truck. In this website, i used bootstrap for the first time to enhance the look of the website compared to its original version. It was my first time dealing with bootstrap, i should add that it made my experience of creating website a whole lot easier. 
    

CSS
-> The look of the page is then altred with the use of the .css file. most of its porpuse was to add color and spacing to the layout, CSS was not as challeging for me compared to learing and referencing the bootstrap documentation. 


JAVASCRIPT
-> A bit of javascript was used to make the navigational bar respond to the scroll of the mouse. I did not have alot of experience with javascript. barely touch it in college but learned that it is a powerful tool to make parts of the website react to certain input from the user.
